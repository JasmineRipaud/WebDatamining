# WebDatamining
A comparison between chosen parameters in different datasets.

Chosen datasets:

- TGV train stations in France
- College libraries in France
- Public libraries in France

To play with these data, you will first have to use apache-iena-fuseki. 

1) install fuseki and launch fuseki-server.bat.
2) type "http://localhost3030/" in your web navigator (preferably Mozilla Firefox)
3) Create a new dataset and upload the files biblies.ttl, biblip.ttl and gares.ttl in it.
4) Then, open a python terminal and use our code application.py to launch our little application
5) A little menu will propose you some types of queries you can apply to this dataset, choosing your parameters.
6) You can also type your own queries of course.
